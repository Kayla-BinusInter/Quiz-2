Original Design: The original page was minimally coloured and some functions have not been added yet. The Navigation bar was confusing to the user and there were no proper functions that prioritizes the user's needs.

New Design: The design above is a tab on the lecturer’s homepage that shows each student’s profile after opening a class. Each of the profiles have a profile picture, name, and NIM of each of the students. 

6 Pattern Implementations:
- Made the navigation bar differently coloured from the original page. Made the tabs highlight when the page is open.
- Added a search function that takes in user input.
- Filter function that helps users to read through the profiles.
- Allow the page to adjust to different sizes.
- The content and date are presented better with necessary information only.
